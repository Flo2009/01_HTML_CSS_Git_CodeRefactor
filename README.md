# 01_HTML_CSS_Git_CodeRefactor

## Description

- The motivation of the project was to improve the structure of the HTMl and CSS as well as to remove some bugs. 
- The website was not functioning properly and the code unstructured and clunky
- The imnprovements fixed the links and the title of the page. The code is now leaner and the elements follow the regulations.
- I learned how to navigate better within github, I had to get a better understanding of the HTML elements and their meaning/usage, I had to learn the functions of the css classes.
